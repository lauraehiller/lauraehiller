# Hi, Laura here! [![Social Media](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=codepen&theme=light)](https://codepen.io/eofnums)[![Social Media](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linkedin&theme=light)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-e-hiller/)

I'm a Software Developer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and an exceptional eye for Design!

The intersection of art and engineering is where I shine brightest. My objective on every project is to balance aesthetics, functionality, accessibility, and performance. The end result? Web applications that are visually stunning, user-friendly, and efficient.

My experience encompasses a wide variety of tools, ranging from Front-End to Back-End development. A few technologies I've been working with recently are React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Sass, and GraphQL.

If you believe that I might be a good fit for a project or role, please get in touch! I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
